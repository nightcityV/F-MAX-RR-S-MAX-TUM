poi_data: The information of POIs has been saved, and subtable 1 includes the rewards for users' single data collection and time windows. Subtable 2 includes the number of times POI needs to collect data, and the value of each coverage to the service provider.

poi_map: This file records the actual distance from each POI to the adjacent POIs, with the aim of converting the actual map into an undirected graph, facilitating the calculation of user time consumption and other costs.

route_dataset: This file records the route dataset generated by F-MAX-RR, used for S-MAX-TUM, each row of the table represents a route and the numbers in the route represent the POIs number. Due to policy constraints, only a portion of the dataset can be uploaded. 

F-MAX-RR: The algorithm for the first stage.

S-MAX-TUM: The algorithm for the second stage.
